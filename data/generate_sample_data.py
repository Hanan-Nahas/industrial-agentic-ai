Asset: Centrifugal Pump PX-100 (Offshore water injection skid)

## Operating Envelope
- Nominal speed: 1450 rpm
- Max casing temperature: 95 C
- Vibration alarm threshold: 6.0 mm/s RMS
- Vibration trip threshold: 8.5 mm/s RMS

## Frequent Failure Modes
1. Impeller wear ring erosion due to sand ingress.
2. Mechanical seal face scoring when flush line is blocked.
3. Coupling insert degradation causing high vibration and misalignment.

## Spare Parts
- SP-PX100-IMP-01: Impeller (17-4PH, CNC + balancing)
- SP-PX100-SEAL-07: Mechanical seal cartridge (SiC/SiC)
- SP-PX100-CPL-03: Elastomer coupling insert (NBR)

## Service Notes
If vibration exceeds 6.0 mm/s and seal pot pressure is normal, inspect coupling insert and impeller balance first.

Scope: pressure-containing and non-pressure critical spare parts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- CT scan porosity < 0.5% for pressure boundary parts.
- Dimensional tolerance: +/-0.1 mm unless drawing states otherwise.
- Hardness range for 17-4PH H900: 38-42 HRC.
- Surface roughness Ra <= 3.2 um on sealing interfaces.

## Inspection Workflow
1. Verify digital thread package (CAD, build orientation, material certs).
2. In-process monitoring log review.
3. Post-build heat treatment validation.
4. Final CMM and NDT report release.

Common symptom mapping:
- Rattling noise + pressure fluctuation => likely suction valve plate fatigue.
- High discharge temperature + low flow => potential piston ring wear.

- SP-CM220-VLV-11 (suction valve plate) critical, min stock 2.
- SP-CM220-RING-02 (ring set) medium criticality.
